# Superstore Sales Analysis Using Power BI and SQL

## Problem Statement

The Superstore Sales Analysis project aims to analyze the sales data of a fictional superstore to gain valuable insights for driving business decisions. The challenges involve cleaning and transforming the raw data, performing exploratory analysis, and visualizing the findings in an intuitive and informative manner.

## Solution

The solution involves leveraging Python for data cleaning and transformation tasks. The Excel dataset is cleaned and converted to a CSV file, which is then imported into a SQL database. SQL queries are utilized to extract relevant information and derive insights from the dataset. Power BI is used as the visualization tool to create interactive and visually appealing reports.

### Components

- **Python Scripts**: These scripts are used for data cleaning and transformation of the Excel dataset.
- **SQL Dump File**: This file contains the SQL commands for importing the transformed data into a SQL database.
- **SQL Queries**: These queries are used for performing exploratory analysis and extracting insights from the sales data.
- **Power BI Project File (.pbix)**: This file contains the interactive reports with three pages: sales performance, customer analysis, and product analysis.

The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization using Power BI. The interactive reports provide valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product analysis, facilitating informed decision-making.

Feel free to explore the project, use the provided scripts and queries, and adapt the analysis to your own datasets. The repository is open for contributions, suggestions, and improvements to enhance the Superstore Sales Analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains sales data from a fictional superstore. It includes information about orders, customers, products, and sales transactions. The dataset is provided in an Excel format and consists of multiple sheets containing the following data:

- **Orders**: Information about each order placed, including order ID, order date, ship date, and customer ID.
- **Customers**: Details of the customers, including customer ID, name, segment, country, and region.
- **Products**: Information about the products sold in the superstore, including product ID, category, sub-category, and product name.
- **Sales**: Transactional data containing details of each sale, including order ID, product ID, quantity, sales amount, and discount.

The dataset spans a certain period of time and contains records of sales transactions made by different customers for various products. It provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, and regional trends.

The goal of this project is to clean and analyze the sales data, extract meaningful insights, and visualize the findings using Power BI. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to aid business decision-making and improve the overall performance of the superstore.
